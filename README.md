# DigitsNet
Hand drawn digit classifier with a deep neaural network (NN).
A 3-layer NN was trained to obtain the weights which were then used to predict the user drawn digits.
The drawing is done with HTML5 canvas object.
The NN code written and python was taken from [makeyourownneuralnetwork](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork)
